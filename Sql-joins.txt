SQL JOIN
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Let's look at a selection from the "Orders" table:

OrderID	CustomerID	OrderDate
10308	2	        1996-09-18
10309	37	        1996-09-19
10310	77	        1996-09-20
Then, look at a selection from the "Customers" table:

CustomerID	CustomerName	                        ContactName	    Country
1	        Alfreds Futterkiste	                    Maria Anders	Germany
2	        Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	    Ana Trujillo	Mexico
3	        Antonio Moreno Taquer√≠a	                Antonio Moreno	Mexico
