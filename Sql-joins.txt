SQL JOIN
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Let's look at a selection from the "Orders" table:

OrderID	CustomerID	OrderDate
10308	2	        1996-09-18
10309	37	        1996-09-19
10310	77	        1996-09-20
Then, look at a selection from the "Customers" table:

CustomerID	CustomerName	                        ContactName	    Country
1	        Alfreds Futterkiste	                    Maria Anders	Germany
2	        Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	    Ana Trujillo	Mexico
3	        Antonio Moreno Taquería	                Antonio Moreno	Mexico

Notice that the "CustomerID" column in the "Orders" table refers to the "CustomerID" in the "Customers" table.
The relationship between the two tables above is the "CustomerID" column.

Then, we can create the following SQL statement (that contains an INNER JOIN), that selects records that
have matching values in both tables:
    SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
    FROM Orders
    INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
and it will produce something like this:

OrderID	CustomerName	                    OrderDate
10308	Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	9/18/1996
10365	Antonio Moreno Taquería	            11/27/1996
10383	Around the Horn	                    12/16/1996
10355	Around the Horn	                    11/15/1996
10278	Berglunds snabbköp	                8/12/1996

Different Types of SQL JOINs
Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

 JOIN Three Tables
The following SQL statement selects all orders with customer and shipper information:

Example
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM ((Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);
