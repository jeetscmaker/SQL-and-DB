SQL JOIN
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Let's look at a selection from the "Orders" table:

OrderID	CustomerID	OrderDate
10308	2	        1996-09-18
10309	37	        1996-09-19
10310	77	        1996-09-20
Then, look at a selection from the "Customers" table:

CustomerID	CustomerName	                        ContactName	    Country
1	        Alfreds Futterkiste	                    Maria Anders	Germany
2	        Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	    Ana Trujillo	Mexico
3	        Antonio Moreno Taquer√≠a	                Antonio Moreno	Mexico

Notice that the "CustomerID" column in the "Orders" table refers to the "CustomerID" in the "Customers" table.
The relationship between the two tables above is the "CustomerID" column.

Then, we can create the following SQL statement (that contains an INNER JOIN), that selects records that
have matching values in both tables:
    SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
    FROM Orders
    INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
